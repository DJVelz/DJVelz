## Hi there, feel free to look around my Github profile 👋

### About me:

My name is Dereck, a full-stack software developer with hands-on experience building Java and Python-backed web applications using modern frameworks, REST APIs, and relational databases. I enjoy turning ideas into reliable, user-focused systems and learning how software can create real-world impact.

I’ve worked on full-stack projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to data analytics dashboards, and I currently work remotely evaluating AI systems, where I apply structured analysis, attention to detail, and technical judgment in real-world workflows.

I’m seeking an early-career software development role where I can grow under mentorship, contribute across the stack, and build technology that supports meaningful outcomes. Always open to connecting with engineers, recruiters, and mission-driven teams.

### Some of the technologies I've used on my journey:
